# Atlas Project Roadmap

## Project Overview
Atlas is a monitoring platform designed to track system health metrics and display them through a sleek web interface. This tool is intended to help both developers and IT administrators monitor the performance of their machines in real-time.

## Project Vision
The long-term goal for Atlas is to provide a comprehensive platform that allows users to:
- Monitor CPU, memory, disk, and network usage
- Visualize system health via interactive web dashboards
- Integrate with other systems to provide alerts and logs
- Be easily deployable on various environments (local machines, remote servers, etc.)

## Major Milestones
- **MVP (Minimum Viable Product)**:
  - Create a simple web page displaying basic system stats (CPU, RAM, disk usage)
  - Use Flask for the backend and basic HTML/CSS for the frontend
  - Store stats in a local database for persistence
- **Dynamic Updates**:
  - Implement real-time updates on the web page via WebSockets or AJAX polling
- **Advanced Visualization**:
  - Add graphs, charts, and interactive elements for a more detailed dashboard
- **Cross-Platform Deployment**:
  - Ensure Atlas can run on multiple environments (Linux, Windows, Mac)
- **Deployment and Scaling**:
  - Implement features for deploying Atlas on remote servers and monitoring multiple machines at once
  - Add user authentication for secure access to stats

## Technologies Used
- **Backend**: Python, Flask
- **Frontend**: HTML, CSS, JavaScript (for dynamic content)
- **Database**: SQLite or PostgreSQL (if persistence is needed)
- **Real-Time Updates**: WebSockets / AJAX
- **Deployment**: Docker (for easy deployment and containerization)
